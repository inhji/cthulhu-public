# Cthulhu

Cthulhu is a monolithic beast that houses a GraphQL-Server, [my homepage](https://inhji.de), static versions of my writing and more.

Cthulhu API is a GraphQL Server that pulls in data about myself from various sources. It is consumed by itself and cthulhu-android, a simple habit tracker I built for myself.

You can browse the Endpoint with [GraphiQL](https://inhji.de/api/graphiql).

## Tech Stack

### Server

* Apollo GraphQL Server
* Express.js
* Mongoose.js

### Client
